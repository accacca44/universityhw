# Description of the repositori "universityhw"
These are all the materials I made and gathered  throughout the semesters of CSUBB
These will include 6 semesters, with all the codes, course videos, and excersices I made.
All of the codes here are the homework, or some of them may be personal projects. The codes uploaded contain necessary algorithms, for taking the exam. Mostly written in C++, C, and Assembly.
